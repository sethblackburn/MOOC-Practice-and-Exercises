// This was a bit tricky.  First I had to figure out the two separate counters in the loop.  Also I had to
// research to figure out that a simple += could be used to add characters to the end of a String.  If that was
// something that was covered earlier in MOOC, I neglected to get it into my Java Notes Google Doc... :/

import java.util.Scanner;

public class PalidromeChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Type a text: ");
        String text = reader.nextLine();
        if (palindrome(text)) {
            System.out.println("The text is a palindrome!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The text is not a palindrome!");
        }
    }

// I was able to recycle the loop from the "reverse" method in Exercise 56.  I ended up altering so much that it
// didn't saved a ton of writing time, but it did save me the trouble having to figure it out again.  And the wonders
// of GitHub means I don't have to have eidetic memory to bring that past solution back.

    public static boolean palindrome(String text) {
        int counter = 0;
        int extractor = 1;
        String paliCheck = "";

        while (counter <= (text.length() - 1)) {
            paliCheck += text.charAt(text.length() - extractor);
            counter++;
            extractor++;
        }
