// Getting the "for" statement to work just right was a bit tricky.  This was the first time I can remember where I
// was brushing up against another schedule commitment, had to leave this one undone, and then figured it out in my
// head about an hour later.  I've heard other coders talk about this sort of thing.  It's an interesting feeling.

import java.util.ArrayList;

        list.add(3);
        list.add(2);
        list.add(7);

// I'm starting to get a bit bothered by how many of these exercises leave such wide open possibilities of error due to
// user input. Yeah I know that's not the POINT of these programs, but still...
