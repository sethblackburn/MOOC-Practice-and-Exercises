# MOOC-Practice-and-Exercises

This repository contains very simple Java programs, escalating in complexity in chronological order, based on free-form practice and specific exercises found at: https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/.  All code was written, compiled, and tested by me in IntelliJ IDEA.
