# MOOC-Practice-and-Exercises

This repository is filled with very simple Java programs, escalating in complexity in chronological order, based on free-form practice and specific exercises found at: https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/.  All code was written, compiled, and tested in IntelliJ IDEA.

The location of the exercise or practice routine on which the code is based is noted at the top of the code after a // designation.  Once reaching the URL, one must scroll down to the relevant chapter.
