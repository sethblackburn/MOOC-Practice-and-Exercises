# MOOC-Practice-and-Exercises

This repository is filled with very simple Java programs, escalating in complexity in chronological order, based on free-form practice and specific exercises found at: https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/

A description of the location within the page--as well as the URL of the page--of the exercise or practice routine on which the code is based is noted at the top of the code after a // designation.
