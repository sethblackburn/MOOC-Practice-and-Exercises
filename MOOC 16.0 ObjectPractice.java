    // Strings are objects, meaning they have a value and they have methods.
    // Objects, like the Scanner above ^^^ must be created with the "new" command.
    // Strings are exceptional, they can be created with the "new" command, as shown:

        String banana = new String("Banana");

    // Strings can also be created in the same way as a variable/value, as I've done so far:

        String carrot = "Carrot";

        System.out.println(banana);

        System.out.println(carrot);    
    }
