// MOOC 8.2 Exercise 16   https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part1/week-1/   This was my first program that contained conditional statements, coded in about 5 minutes on 19 Sept 2019. At that point, I'd been teaching myself Java for about an hour a day for six days. Prior to that six-day stretch, I'd never before worked with Java.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FirstIfElse {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner numInput = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
            double num = numInput.nextDouble();

        if(num == 0){
            System.out.print(num + " is neither positive nor negative.");
        } else {
        if(num > 0){
            System.out.print(num + " is positive.");
        } else {
            System.out.print(num + " is negative.");
        }
        }
    }
}
